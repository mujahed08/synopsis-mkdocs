# Sliding window

## Minimum Window Substring
**Hard**

<div class="scrollable-section">

Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window 
substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included 
in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
<br/><br/>

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.<br/><br/>


Example 1:<br/><br/>

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"<br/>
Output: "BANC"<br/>
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.<br/>
Example 2:<br/><br/>

Input: s = "a", t = "a"<br/>
Output: "a"<br/>
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.<br/>
Example 3:<br/><br/>

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"<br/>
Output: ""<br/>
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.<br/>
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.<br/><br/>

Constraints:<br/><br/>

m == s.length<br/>
n == t.length<br/>
1 <= m, n <= 105<br/>
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.<br/><br/>
