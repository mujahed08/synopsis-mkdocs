# A FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEWS

- Design a well-known product X New Product


- The questions are seems ambigious and unreasonably broad.


- No one expects you to design a popular product in an hour.


- The system design interview simulates real-life problem solving where two co-workers collaborate on an ambiguous problem and come up with a solution that meets their goals. The problem is open-ended, and there is no perfect answer. The final design is less important compared to the work you put in the design process. This allows you to demonstrate your design skill, defend your design choices, and respond to feedback in a constructive manner.


- Many think that system design interview is all about a person's technical design skills. It is much more than that. An effective system design interview gives strong signals about a person's ability to collaborate, to work under pressure, and to resolve ambiguity constructively. The ability to ask good questions is also an essential skill, and many interviewers specifically look for this skill.


- A good interviewer also looks for red flags. Over-engineering is a real disease of many engineers as they delight in design purity and ignore tradeoffs. They are often unaware of the compounding costs of over-engineered systems, and many companies pay a high price for that ignorance. You certainly do not want to demonstrate this tendency in a system design interview. Other red flags include narrow mindedness, stubbornness, etc.

## 4-step process for effective system design interview

Every system design interview is different. A great system design interview is open-ended
and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. However, there are steps and common ground to
cover in every system design interview.

### Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope

1. In a system design interview, giving out an answer quickly without thinking gives you no
bonus points. Answering without a thorough understanding of the requirements is a huge red
flag as the interview is not a trivia contest. There is no right answer.


- So, do not jump right in to give a solution. Slow down. Think deeply and ask questions to
clarify requirements and assumptions. This is extremely important.


- As an engineer, we like to solve hard problems and jump into the final design; however, this
approach is likely to lead you to design the wrong system. One of the most important skills as
an engineer is to ask the right questions, make the proper assumptions, and gather all the
information needed to build a system. So, do not be afraid to ask questions.


- When you ask a question, the interviewer either answers your question directly or asks you to
make your assumptions. If the latter happens, write down your assumptions on the
whiteboard or paper. You might need them later.

- What kind of questions to ask? Ask questions to understand the exact requirements. Here is a
list of questions to help you get started:

    - What specific features are we going to build?
    - How many users does the product have?
    - How fast does the company anticipate to scale up? What are the anticipated scales in 3
    months, 6 months, and a year?
    - What is the company’s technology stack? What existing services you might leverage to
    simplify the design?
