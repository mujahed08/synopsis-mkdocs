## A FRAMEWORK FOR SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEWS

- Design a well-known product X
New Product
- The questions are seems ambigious and unreasonably broad.
- No one expects you to design a popular product in an hour.
- The system design interview simulates real-life problem solving where two co-workers
collaborate on an ambiguous problem and come up with a solution that meets their goals. The
problem is open-ended, and there is no perfect answer. The final design is less important
compared to the work you put in the design process. This allows you to demonstrate your
design skill, defend your design choices, and respond to feedback in a constructive manner.
- Many think that system design interview is all about a person's technical design skills. It is
much more than that. An effective system design interview gives strong signals about a
person's ability to collaborate, to work under pressure, and to resolve ambiguity
constructively. The ability to ask good questions is also an essential skill, and many
interviewers specifically look for this skill.
- A good interviewer also looks for red flags. Over-engineering is a real disease of many
engineers as they delight in design purity and ignore tradeoffs. They are often unaware of the
compounding costs of over-engineered systems, and many companies pay a high price for
that ignorance. You certainly do not want to demonstrate this tendency in a system design
interview. Other red flags include narrow mindedness, stubbornness, etc.
